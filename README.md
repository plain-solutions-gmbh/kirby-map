## Installation

**Manually**

[Download](https://github.com/youngcut/kirby-map) and copy the plugin into your plugin folder: `/site/plugins/`

**With Composer**

`composer require microman/kirby-map`

## Configuration

Kirby Map uses [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for geolocation and map view. For internal purposes, a default token is already set. You probably want to replace that for your specific use-case.

To use Mapbox on your website, create your very own [access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens) and set it in your config file: `/site/config/config.php`

```php
return [
  'microman.map.token' => 'YOUR-TOKEN'
];
```

## Geolocation field

Here's an example how to use the geolocationg field in your blueprint:

```yaml
myGeoLocation:
  label: My Geolocation
  type: geolocation
  default:
    name: "Berlin"
    lat: 13.38333
    lng: 52.51667
```

### How to use the geolocation field in your template

```php
<?php $mylocation = $page->myGeoLocation()->toLocation() ?>

Name: <?= $mylocation->name() ?>
Latitude: <?= $mylocation->lat() ?>
Longitude: <?= $mylocation->lng() ?>
```

## Map block

![Map block](./.github/screenshot-maps.png)

With the Map block, you can set up your map with a live preview. To add this block to your blueprint, simply add a `blocks` field:

```yaml
myContent:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    - maps
```

To customize the default block blueprints, copy the two files located in `/site/plugins/kirby-map/blueprints/blocks/` to your blocks blueprint folder: `/site/blueprints/blocks`

### Markers

You can add as many markers as you want right from within your map block. Try to place your marker in the visible preview.

### How to use the map block in your template

The map will be rendered inside your block field.

By default, the Block outputs an open source Mapbox instance.

If you want to use the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) copy and rename `/site/plugins/kirby-map/lib/examples/google-maps.php` to `site/snippets/blocks/maps.php`

> Don't forget to replace `[YOUR-API]` with your [Google-API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) in the last line.
